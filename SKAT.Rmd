## R Markdown

Markdown example of running a SKAT-o pipeline on toy data.

Load example data.
```{r cars}
#An example dataset (SKAT.example) has a genotype matrix (Z) of 2000 individuals and 67 SNPs, vectors of continuous (y.c) and binary (y.b) phenotypes, and a covariates matrix (X).
data(SKAT.example)
names(SKAT.example)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
